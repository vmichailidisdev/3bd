Every gamer knows that the more purple and pink you add to your setup, the better you become, so went all out. Sweet like lavender honey, savory like.. shit I don’t know. We wanted solid aluminum case, a lot of purple, RGB, and top of the line gaming switches.

At it’s core it’s a black NK65 with Cherry Gold plate mounted stabs. All clipped and lubed up as should be. Switch choice landed on the less known, and very very underrated Kailh Polia lubed with NK Krytox 204g00. HK Gaming purple puddings and rubber WASD and arrow clusters. A novelty Esc key and blank milks for the additional keys.

Having tried a chunk popular tactile switches we wanted something less sensitive than the Gods of gaming Kailh Speed Copper, but with enough kick let us know we’re actually pressing the keys. Marketing aside, once lubed with 204g00 these switches are fantastic. No problem typing away during work hours and jumping immediately into long sessions of your favorite fps game. These switches, perhaps looked down upon by the typist coffee-shop cactus plant miniature elite andy community are tippety top all-around gaming switches.

Details:

- Tron Black NK65 V1
- Kailh Polia lubed with NK Krytox 204g00
- Band-aid modded, clipped, lubed Cherry gold plate stabs
- HK Gaming purple pudding, black pudding, and purple rubber caps, with a couple of milks for garnish.
- Custom purple double sleeves aviator cable
