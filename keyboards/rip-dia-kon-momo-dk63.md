Ok, all right, fine, this isn’t necessarily a board for gamers, but you can definitely game on it. And the Gat blacks obviously provides a sound that makes the entire office come over and drool. Origin is simple; I found a Dierya DK63 cheap and couldn’t resist because the form factor is nice, it got that Bluetooth and USB-C. So is it any good?

I’d argue, in its standard format out the box, the DK63 is kind of what you would expect from any cheaper bt combo board. Not on par with Anne Pro or Akko but not terrible. Obviously, the original brown or red switches and stabs all needed replacing or a big chunk of love.

First of all, the DK63 is not a hot swap so all the whatever switches needed to go. I kept the stock stabs as they seemed fine, just needed a decent amount of lube and some end wraps to eliminate any rattle. For swtiches I went with Gateron Blacks lubed with 205g0 since I intended to test this out in the office. The sound in plastic cases can’t be compared to a proper aluminum case, but it got good once I taped modded the board. Dropped a Kon Momo set on to go with the white case and for what it was, this thing is banging. I’ve already got offers on it, but I don’t know, kinda hard to let go of DIA. Miss a lot!

Details:

- Dierya DK63
- Stock stabs, lubed, end wrapped
