This is a commission build to a dear friend making his way through the ranks with an old membrane board. The poor man couldn’t keep up with the speed of a new generation of gamers and was looking to upgrade his equipment. He wanted a smaller sized board, with RGB, tuned and perfected to dominate the opposition without breaking the bank.

We took a basic RoyalKludge RK71, swapped out the tired Gateron Browns with a full set of Kailh Speed Copper, lubed with a magic GPL 203 and 105 mixture. Stabs were clipped, band-aid modded, and lubed for a smooth yet violent sound. Accent caps from an Akko 3068.

Details:

- Lubed Kailh Speed Copper switches
- Clipped, band-aid modded, lubed stock stabilizers
- Original caps + Akko accents
- Full RGB + side RGB
- Tested and proven worthy of leaderboard domination
