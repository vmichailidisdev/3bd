Engagement ring? Engagement Keyboard!

Why give her a boring old ring when you can give her the ultimate frag tool? Let her rise up like the royalty she is to you and show her your loyalty with a true Royal keyboard; or take the throne yourself and reign supreme.

We started off with a subtle yet elegant low profile aluminum case in a stunning rose gold color. Depending on the light it changes from peach, to silver, to rose gold; all which catches the eye and leads them to the inverted pudding caps and the regular pudding accents. Speaking of accents, blast that RGB on full and the pudding accents will let you know their presence, while the inverted puddings gently lets some light out.

We matched the case and caps with a set of Kailh Box Crystal Royal emphasizing the true superiority in this board. Crystal Royals feel snappy and light, offering a perfect blend for typing and fragging.

She was born to be Royalty, you were born to be her Champion.
