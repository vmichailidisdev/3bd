Another Royal Kludge Bluetooth USB-C combo board. Not much to celebrate in its original form but with a bit of TLC it turned out quite well.

It all started with a basic Red led RK60 with Outemo Browns. Stabs were absolutely horrible and the entire board rattled more than a rattlesnake. We swapped out the subpar switches with modded Gateron Clears w 80g Cherry springs, lubed with GPL 205, and filmed with clear Kin switch films. Base caps were swapped to a white backlit with red accents and an artisan space bar.

The result, although not visually extravagant is a well performing board that handles gaming as well as office work, if you consider those different. Typing is buttery smooth with a thicc sound, but certainly not for the weak with those massive springs.

Details:

- Lubed, filmed, Gateron Clears w 80g Cherry springs
- Clipped, band-aid modded, lubed stock stabilizers
- Original + white base backlit + red accents + artisan space caps
- Red PCB leds
- All-arounder in a small form factor
