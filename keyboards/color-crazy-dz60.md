The R3Bd V2 was a little project to make one helluva glowing RGBeast and build something from scratch. A keyboard made for everyday use, compact, sleek, yet in your face with insane glow.

Run it in full RGB for a lovely rainbow effect or turn off the top leds and underglow for a subtle white/blue shaded board with its clear case, reminding of the patio in a intermediate beach patio.

We took a basic clear case, a clear plastic plate and a Kebo DZ60RGB underglow PCB. The board was modded to fit the GK64 layout in QMK. Switches are Gateron Clears modded with 80g Cherry springs, filmed, and lubed with GPL 205. Caps are Ducky Bon Voyage and an assortment of Cherry profile accents, with backlit arrow cluster and space. Approximately 1 lbs of aquarium weights were added to the bottom of the case to balance the light weight of the components (see side view).
