This right here is the daily driver of the Butcher himself, a slightly modified Ducky One 2 SF RGB.

65% might be the absolutely best size for a keyboard. Why? Dedicated arrow keys without being cramped in a 60% case, yet small enough that you won’t hit your mouse to the side of the board when making those big swipes.

This specific board came with MX Speed Silver switches; an absolute atrocity typing on and quite difficult to game on as even the slightest touch would trigger the keys. We swapped the MX Speed Silver to Kailh Speed Copper switches, which have a slight bump early in the stroke, avoiding unnecessary key presses, yet keeping that short travel and quick response. Switches are lubed with GPL 203 but not modded in any other way. Caps are a combination of GK64 Black backlits, our 3Bd signature space bar and stock Ducky accents.

The result is a game dominating tool for the highest level gaming experience, at a price that will leave plenty room for all those post game celebration parties you’ll be having.

Details:

- Kailh Speed Copper lubed with GPL 203
- Band-aid modded, lubed stock Ducky stabilizers
- GK64 Black backlit + Custom Space + Ducky Accent caps
- Full RGB
- Not just the best, but the Beast budget gaming keyboard
