More Purple and pink? Eh yeah bebe, a lot more. Since we already have a solid Purple gaming keyboard in the Purple Kiss NK65 it was time to make a purple general purpose keyboard. Aimed more towards a comfortable typing experience, but well equipped to handle everything thrown at it.

At its core it’s an underglow DZ60 with purple single color leds soldered to it, giving a beautiful unison glow from top to bottom, almost as if was a single light source. The case is a regular poker acrylic 60% diffusing the underglow absolutely fantastic with a sleek look even with the underglow off. We’ve tried adding weights and stuff to get that nice heft, but nothing beats a good ol brass plate, which is why we had to go with it.

The switches were a bit of an experiment where we simply swapped out the stock Gateron Clear springs with a set of 80g. Surprisingly, or maybe not, the swapped springs bring the Clears to the next level, with a buttery silky smooth bebe bebe typing experience. No fatigue, but enough force to let you know that you’re interacting with them. What a jackpot this turned out to be.

Caps are a color matched set from Geek Social offering good quality at a very reasonable price. Purple puddings were added on the arrow cluster and Esc key to give some nice accents to the look.
