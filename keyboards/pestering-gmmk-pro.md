Probably the most common starter board at this point; the GMMK Pro. Base kit generally in stock and for a good price. Unfortunately, this kit was a pushed a little too hard in the media. It suffers from some serious design flaws, with a mishmash of various screw types, and insane amount of screws and generally poor planning. For being Glorious first kit, it’s not bad.

The StupidFish foam inlays does help a lot with sound, but due to the poor design more foam is probably needed, but this specific unit suffers from too much pressure on the PCB if too much foam is used. Had to settle with actually being able to use the board with a pretty decent sound.

Clearly I’m on a purple-ish roll, and the lavender puddings and Akko just looked so damn good on this board. It’s a bit too big for shooters, but any MMO or Strategy player might find the TKL a perfect match. Big ups for the spinny wheel; completely useless in my case, but super satisfying to turn it.

All in all, despite heaps of room for improvement, this board is good. It’s hefty, got decent sound, and comes in at a stellar price. Frag out young gamer, frag out.

Details:

- GMMK Pro Black
- Stock stabs, lubed, end wrapped
- lubed Kailh Polia
- Glorious Black Pudding w Lavender pudding and Akko accents + a milk drop for flare
