Another commission. This one was actually the first one we received. It’s been a long time in the making and although some caps are still in transit, we’re so excited about the result we might leave it as is.

The build starts with a Black Anode Aluminum case with a GK64 RGB Hotswap PCB. Like with the Tofu build the plated needed some minor sanding to fit snug in the case. We added a few electrical tape strips to cushion the contact. The PCB was band aid modded, stabs clipped and lubed with GPL 205. Box Brown switches offers good typing and snappy gaming performance, perfect for long coding sessions and mid night frag outs. We kept some of the stock caps but swapped the mid base and arrow cluster for Black Puddings to highlight the per key RGB. WASD cluster replaced with Tai-Hao rubber keys for insane grip, and a few red accents added for some flare, with our signature space bar as the cherry on top.

It’s thicc, it’s snappy, it’s aggressive; this board is like a Lambo Diablo of gaming. WROOM! We know the customer will be pleased, we would.
