Ever since seeing this case I’ve been wanting to work with it. The simple yet aggressive curves combined with the diffuser plate gives it a futuristic and unique look with a solid functional unibody design. It sports a contemporary look with black on dark grey mods, with a cream Korean base and a couple of red accents.

Originally with Novelkeys x Kailh Speed Heavy Burnt Orange, which proved a bit too thick and heavy. Out with them! Now updated with snappy and smooth Longhua Blacks.

Details:

- Steel bent case with acrylic diffuser
- Kebo DZ60 RGB
- Previously: Novelkeys X Kailh Speed Heavy Burnt Orange lubed with Krytox 203g0 mix
- Currently: Longhua (Kailh) Black (CPG151101D01) lubed with Novelkeys 204g0
- Band-aid modded, lubed, screw in stabs
- low profile Cream ANSI/Korean caps with black on dark grey mods and red accents
- Red top leds
- Full underglow RGB
