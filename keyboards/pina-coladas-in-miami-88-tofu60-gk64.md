This build right here is a prototype for a commission, but might just be our favorite so far.

The Tofu60 case is not just hefty and sturdy, but absolutely gorgeous too. Paired with a hotswap GK64 PCB from a stock prebuilt and we have a versatile and powerful board.

To achieve a good compatibility with the hotswap PCB the original plate was sanded down on all sides until it fit the case perfectly. We then popped in a full set of Zealios V2s lubed with GPL 203 and a Speed Copper for the space key. We kept the original stabs but band aid moodded the PCB and clipped and lubed the stabs with GPL 205. As a final touch we elected for white Pudding base caps, for that extra RGB sensation, with grey modifiers, and two different Miami Punch accents and an artisan space bar. Perfect for those sunny days on the beach.

We really like this board! It wasn’t intended for gaming with the tactile Zealios V2 switches, but has the ability to turn it up with its full RGB and hotswap sockets.

Details:

- Silver Tofu60 aluminum case
- GK64 hotswap full RGB PCB
- Modded stock GK64 alu plate
- Zealios V2 lubed with GPL 203
- Band-aid modded, lubed stock GK64 stabilizers
- White pudding + Grey mods + Miami Punch 2x + Artisan space caps
- Full RGB
- Perfect for both chilling with a Pina Colada in the afternoon as for that hot Miami beach party.
