Serene, surreptitious, superior.

Another wood case screaming salubrity but hiding serious power underneath.

We oiled the case with Old English scratch cover, for that extra smooth surface and durability to withstand night long creative or gaming sessions. We modded a metal plate to allow PCB screw in stabs on the spacebar and enter keys, combined with the stock plate mounted stabs. Some of the artisan caps were sanded down to avoid slamming into the plate as well.

The switch choice was easy; we needed something capable of some serious fragging but honoring the typist feel of the keyboard, Zealios 62G fits that description perfect. Switches lubed with Novelkeys 204g0 for an intense smoothness.

The result is the perfect companion; sophisticated poet by day, colorful party animal by night.
