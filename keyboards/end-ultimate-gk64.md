Difference. Everybody have different taste, we are drawn to different things. This keyboard doesn’t care, it’s a keyboard! But it’s superior, it’s better than you, better than the opposition. It knows it, and as soon as you put your hands on it, you know it. You might switch it out, but you’ll be right back with it. You might hate how it looks, but you’ll lovingly stare at it anyways. It made the decision for you. It’s the end. It’s End.Ultimate.

It all starts with the Tron aluminum case. Solid, hefty, and a diffuser plate that lets just enough light through from the SMD leds. You pop an underglow PCB in this and it’ll be a party. We elected for something more subtle. The PCB is a simple hotswap GK64. It does it all, and it does it all well. We modded the plate so we can use a Durock PCB mounted while the others are stock plate mounts.

What really makes this thing go are the Zilents 62g. Lightly lubed with Novelkeys 204g0. They’re very tactile like other ZealPC switches, but light enough to be comfortable, all while not making a fuss about it. The WASD cluster and spacebar are lubed Kailh Speed Copper – the best gaming switch around. As a package, you get a set of switches that let’s you type away and hit those macros without miss-pressing, while letting your full speed loose on the cluster.

The caps is a feature film of itself. It all starts with backlit Korean ANSI base keys with outlined mods with red accents. The WASD cluster is a set of fully transparent blank milk caps, for that ultimate RGB. Spacebar is our signature 3Bd backlit beast. Together they form a tasteful hyper aggression, the end of all keyboard designs.

It don’t matter what your neighbor bought at best buy, or how many hundreds he paid for that pre-built snake thing. When you’re with this thing, you know you’re above them. You know you have the power to end them at your will.
